## Introduction

This is a good spot to add some of your initial thoughts. What questions are you trying to answer? Where did you get the data from? Include [links](https://pudding.cool) to your sources and things you found helpful along the way. Your future self will thank you.

Also, this file is written in Rmarkdown. If you're new to Rmd, the [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) from RStudio may be useful for you.

### Load Packages

Here are a few packages that I recommend using for Pudding analysis projects. Since I suggest doing R data analysis the "tidy" way, you can save yourself a step and install the whole `tidyverse`. If you don't have these packages installed on your machine, install them like this: `install.packages(tidyverse)` and then load them using `library()`.

When you load `tidyverse` as a package, it automatically loads `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `purrr`, `tibble`, `stringr`, and `forcats`.

```{r load_packages}
# I recommend always loading these

# For general data cleaning and analysis
library(tidyverse)

# For keeping your files in relative directories
library(here)

###

# These can be loaded on a case-by-case basis

# If your data includes dates that need to be wrangled
library(lubridate)

# If you need to import data from Excel formats
library(readxl)

# If you need to import data from JSON formats
library(jsonlite)

# If you want to interact with Google Drive (e.g., upload or download files)
library(googledrive)

# If you want to download more than the 1st sheet of a Google Sheet
library(googlesheets)

# For interactive/searchable tables in your report
library(DT)

# For incorporating functional Python scripts
library(reticulate)
# Enter which version of python you want to use below and uncomment the code
# reticulate::use_python("~/your_name/bin/python")
```

Arguments from any of these packages can be loaded independently or with their package name. For instance, `dplyr`'s function `mutate` can be run as `...mutate()` or, to ensure that the _correct_ mutate function is being called, you can specify that you want the mutate function from the `dplyr` package like this `dplyr::mutate()`. Both ways work, but the 2nd is more helpful when looking back at old code.

### Load Data

I highly recommend using the `here` package ([more info](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here)) to keep track of your file locations and make sure that file paths don't break if you share your project with someone else. Here's how you may use it to import a new data file:

```{r load_data}
# use here to find the file you want and save the file path to a variable
# in this case, the path would look like "working_directory/raw_data/data.csv"
file_path <- here::here("raw_data", "data.csv")

# from csv
data <- readr::read_csv(file_path)

# from Excel (assuming file_path led to a .xls or .xlsx file)
data <- readxl::read_excel(file_path, sheet = 1)

# from JSON file (assuming file_path led to a .json file)
data <- jsonlite::fromJSON(file_path)
```

If your data exists in Google Drive, you can still access it from right here.

If you are only interested in the first sheet of a google sheet, you can use either `googledrive` or `googlesheets` to access it. I recommend `googledrive`. 

Let's say you have a file in your Google Drive called "myFile". You can download it to your `raw_data` folder and then read it into R like this:

```{r load_gd}
googledrive::drive_download("myFile", 
                            path = here::here("raw_data", "myLocalFile.csv"), 
                            type = "csv", 
                            overwrite = TRUE)

data <- readr::read_csv(here::here("raw_data", "myLocalFile.csv"))
```

Watch out for that `overwrite = TRUE` argument, though! It will download the latest version of your google sheet and overwrite the old one.

If you don't know the sheet name, you can use the URL to the sheet instead:

```{r load_gd_2}
sheetID <- googledrive::as_id("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TW1skGoCvdOyIdjD-2yjiQ6YWAA6EdJTk9g03FeHYtM/edit#gid=772914444")

googledrive::drive_download(sheetID, 
                            path = here("raw_data", "myLocalFile.csv"), 
                            overwrite = TRUE)

data <- readr::read_csv(here::here("raw_data", "myLocalFile.csv"))
```

If you need to access anything other than the first sheet in a Google Sheet, use the `googlesheets` package instead. 

*Heads up*, you may need to authenticate Google Docs by running `gs_ls()` and responding to the prompt that opens in your browser.

Here's how to load any sheet:

```{r load_gs}
# Specify the Title of the File
worksheet <- gs_title("My Awesome File")

# Specify the sheet you need when calling for the file
googlesheets::gs_download(from = worksheet,
                          # enter the name of the tab you want here
                          ws = "name_of_tab",
                          to = here::here("raw_data", "myLocalFile.csv"))

data <- readr::read_csv(here::here("raw_data", "myLocalFile.csv"))
```

## Data Analysis

Here's where all of your beautiful data analysis will live.

All of your code that you wish to execute goes inside code chunks like this (shortcut: Cmd + option + i)

```{r example}
x <- 5 + 2
```

As you can imagine, R scripts run automatically, and are indicated by the `{r}` at the head of each code chunk. To see what other code languages are supported, run `knitr::knit_engines$get()`.

### Incorporating Python

For instance, you can run python scripts like this:

```{python example}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```
However, the fine print of using other language engines (except for `r`, `python`, and `julia`) in R is that they _don't write to memory_. That means that a variable assigned in one `bash` code chunk won't be available in a separate `bash` code chunk. If, instead, you're using `r`, `python` or `julia`, the variables you assign *are* available in other code chunks...of the same language. You can't assign a variable in a `python` code chunk and access it in an `r` code chunk. At least not explicitly. You can access them by defining their environment first though by defining objects created in R as `r.x` and those created in python as `py.x`

```{python assignment}
# define x in python 
x = 10

# print to check it worked
print(x)
```

```{r reading_python}
# Access the x variable defined in python 
py$x
```

Lots more detail on what you can and can't do with Python in R [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html#python) and about the `reticulate` package that makes this possible [here](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/).

### Interactive Tables

By default, outputing an .Rmd file to HTML will generate tables that you can click through. But if you'd like to add some sorting and a search bar, we'll need to use the `datatable` function from the `DT` package. 

Like this:

```{r usage}
DT::datatable(data, rownames = FALSE, filter = "top", options = list(pageLength = 5, scrollX = TRUE))
```
