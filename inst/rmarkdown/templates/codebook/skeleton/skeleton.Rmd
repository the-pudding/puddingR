- **What is this?**: ADD A DESCRIPTION OF YOUR DATASET. 1-2 SUCCINCT SENTENCES
- **Source(s) & Methods**: HOW WAS THIS DATA COLLECTED? INCLUDE ALL RELEVANT LINKS AND CODE USED TO PROCESS DATA.
- **Last Modified**: `r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`
- **Contact Information**: [YOUR NAME](mailto:YOUR-EMAIL@pudding.cool)
- **Spatial Applicability**: ADD INFO ABOUT SPATIAL BOUNDARIES OF DATA (e.g., United States, Global, etc.)
- **Temporal Applicability**: WHAT IS THE TIME RANGE REPRESENTED IN THE DATA? (e.g., if data represents all musical hits from January 2015 - December 2017, this value would be January 01, 2015 - December 31, 2017). The more granular the date range, the better.
- **Observations (Rows)**: There are `r nrow(params$data)` rows in this dataset. DESCRIBE WHAT EACH ROW REPRESENTS.
- **Variables (Columns)**: There are `r ncol(params$data)` columns in this dataset. They are described below:

```{r echo = FALSE}
# DONT EDIT THIS CODE CHUNK
data <- params$data

# gather column names in a table
meta <- tibble::enframe(colnames(data), name = NULL) %>% 
  dplyr::rename("Header" = value) %>% 
  dplyr::rowwise() %>% 
  dplyr::mutate("Description" = case_when(
    class(data[,Header]) == "factor" ~ paste0("levels: ", paste0(levels(data[,Header]), sep = "", collapse = ", ")),
    TRUE ~ "ENTER DESCRIPTION OF THIS COLUMN HERE"
  )) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate("Data Type" = class(data[,Header]))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(meta, format = "markdown")
```

* *Other Notes*: Include any other relevant notes/calculations/code here.

* *Analysis Session Info*: Including any relevant data processing scripts is great practice (seriously, good job! ðŸŽ‰), but for anyone who wants to run your script, they need a little more info. At the very least, make sure that you include any of your session info, so things like:
  * What software you are using (including version number)
  * What packages are you using (including version number)
  * anything else that would help someone re-run your analysis given only the information/data provided in this repo.
